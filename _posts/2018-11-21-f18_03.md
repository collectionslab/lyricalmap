This artifact is a political advertisement endorsed by the Jackie Goldberg Committee and was mailed to Los Angeles residents in 1993 to persuade them to elect Goldberg as their representative in the thirteenth district. Goldberg’s advertisement communicates her goal of eliminating violence in Los Angeles, as she describes how she plans to enforce stricter gun laws. Goldberg describes the NRA’s involvement in preventing the ban of cheap handguns called Saturday Night Specials-- the weapons that killed thousands during the LA Riots just a year before. The advertisement also connects Tom LaBonge, Goldberg’s opponent, to the NRA, a group that supported LaBonge. 

Goldberg’s campaign effectively responds to the context of her time, as the 1992 Los Angeles Riots ended just a year before. The LA Riots are one of the most controversial and violent events in Los Angeles history. They began after a predominately white jury acquitted four white policemen for excessively beating a Black man named Rodney King. A local resident taped King’s beating, and the brutality was so shocking that the police officers were sent to trial. To everyone’s amazement, the officers were acquitted. For six days, communities across Los Angeles looted and burned buildings, using violence to retaliate. More than 700 buildings were burned, 5,000 people were arrested, and 42 Los Angeles residents died during the riots, 70% of them by gunshot (Twomey 80). Traumatized by excessive police brutality and intense gun-violence, people were eager for a change-- especially the kind of change that restricts the sale of ammunition and ownership of these deadly handguns.

Goldberg’s campaign advocated for that change. In her advertisement, she expressed her stand against gun violence and gun ownership in Los Angeles. She exposed the NRA, a group that supported LaBonge, by reporting that the NRA blocked gun control bills by gathering extremists to vote against politicians who oppose them, such as herself. Goldberg’s involvement in politics and social justice began in the early 1960s when she was a member of the Los Angeles City Council and an Assembly Representative to the California State Legislature. During this time, she was heavily involved in Berkeley’s Free Speech movement, fighting for racial integration in sororities (“Free Speech Movement Oral History Project”). Goldberg also extended her involvement by creating learning programs for low-income students from Chicago and Compton (Rogers). She also served as president of the LA School Board a few years later. Goldberg’s community involvement inspired her to run for City Council in 1993. Her experiences influenced her decision to focus her campaign on Los Angeles’ violence, health care, and education issues (Rainey). In regards to reducing violence, as stated in her political advertisement, one of Goldberg’s main goals was to ban Saturday Night Specials to help decrease the availability of ammunition. She also wanted to increase the communication and improve the relationship between neighborhoods and their local police force. 

Goldberg’s opponent, LaBonge, was a member of the Los Angeles City Council from 2001 to 2015 representing the 4th district. Before that, when running for the City Council position in 1993, he narrowly lost to Goldberg by a four-percent margin of votes (Russell). Goldberg was a liberal, focusing her campaign towards union workers, teachers, feminists, LGBTQ people, and minorities. LaBonge, a strong conservative, focused his campaign toward people with a track record of voting in past elections. He mainly targeted those that were conservative. As shown in this artifact, Goldberg criticized LaBonge for accepting financial contributions from registered lobbyists, including the National Rifle Association’s local branch; however, LaBonge was actually in favor of gun control (Russell). By associating him with the NRA, Goldberg put LaBonge in a negative light, as gun control was a sensitive topic. Seventy percent of Americans were in favor of enforcing stricter gun laws (Gallup), as most people were still traumatized from the violence during LA Riots. As a result, Goldberg was the favored candidate at the time and her advertisement against LaBonge’s NRA endorsement portrayed her in a more positive light and helped secure her victory in the 1993 election.

America’s gun control debate traces back to the eighteenth-century. In the twentieth-century, gun ownership and federal regulation of gun control became a major issue, with the National Rifle Association (NRA) as the focal point. The NRA was founded in 1871, initially as an organization to improve the marksmanship of soldiers. Following the implementation of legislation bringing state militia units under federal control in 1903 and creation of the position of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship in 1916, the NRA has been gradually recognized as one of the most influential special interest groups in the country (Marlin). Westside Firearms Association, the local branch of the NRA in Los Angeles in 1993, endorsed LaBonge’s group for the City Council. Having gained support from the NRA, this group opposed every legislation that repressed gun activity. For example, they opposed the ban on Saturday Night Specials, the handgun registration, and the waiting periods for gun purchases. Working against LaBonge and the NRA, Goldberg fought to ban Saturday Night Specials, which helped the later implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1994. The act focused on decreasing gun violence by reducing the availability of handguns to criminals and other potentially dangerous people, thus leading to a 10-year federal ban on assault weapons (Monroe).
